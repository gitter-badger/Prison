## Synopsis

Prison is a plugin for Bukkit and Spigot that combines the strengths of the leading plugins for the prison gamememode, in order to create a functional server simply. 

## Motivation

There are many plugins that add the mines, the ranks, the shops, etc. for prison servers, but they are all made by different developers that work at different paces. Then it gets into the problem of manging all the dependencies and keeping them all up to date - blargh. It's so much simpler to have just one plugin to manage, and this is what Prison offers.

## Installation

1. First, ensure that you are running the latest version of [Spigot](http://spigotmc.org).
2. Now, download and install [Vault](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/vault/) and [WorldEdit](http://www.enginehub.org/worldedit#downloads).
3. Next, download the latest version of [Prison](http://github.com/SirFaizdat/Prison/releases).
4. Install your freshly downloaded copy of Prison by dragging the file into your server's `plugins` folder.
5. Restart your server, and huzzah! If you followed these steps correctly, Prison should be up and running (you can check the status by typing `/prison version`).
